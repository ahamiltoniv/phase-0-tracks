		I'm excited to be working on my first bit of original html content. There's a <strong>lot</strong> to learn about html, but if I work hard and use the reference documentation I can figure it out.

	<h2>
		Git Workflow steps
	</h2>

	<ol>
		<li>Create a feature branch</li>
		<li>Make changes on your feature branch</li>
		<li>Add or Stage your changes</li>
		<li>Make a commit with a good message to "save" your work</li>
		<li>Make your pull request to <a href="http://www.github.com/">Github</a></li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Mistakes that I shouldn't continue to make</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><em>NEVER</em> use git push origin master to skip a pull request</li>
		<li>Remember to create a feature branch instead of working in the master</li>
		<li>Don't forget to frequently add and commit your work</li>
	</ul>
